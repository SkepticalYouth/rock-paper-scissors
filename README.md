# rock-paper-scissors
This is my submission for the Odin project rock-paper scissors assignment. The mini-project was tremendously useful in helping me understand how to manipulate html files using javascript. I don't really know what to say after this, so if you got any suggestions, contact me at chamber2002@gmail.com
